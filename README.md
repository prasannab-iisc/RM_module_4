The Pie Chart shows female population of Tamil Nadu by age groups. It is evident that young female population contributes to a high proportion of the total female population.

The first of Stacked Bar plots compare total number of girls between ages 15 and 19 by district (bottom stack = urban, top stack = rural) and the second one compares number of marriages of the same age group girls by district. It is clear (surprisingly) that proportion of marriages of girls of age 15-19 is higher in Urban areas than Rural areas
